    <p><h1><font color="red">Manpreet Singh 2nd Flagbearer For Indian Contingent At CWG Opening Ceremony</font></h1></p>
    <p><h4>Manpreet Singh named 2nd flagbearer for Indian contingent at CWG opening ceremon
    <p><h4> Men's hockey captain Manpreet Singh has been named the second flagbearer for the Indian contingent at the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony along with PV Sindhu. Sindhu was named India's flagbearer earlier on Wednesday, after Neeraj Chopra pulled out of the event with an injury. However, the decision was taken to name Manpreet Singh as the second flag-bearer as every country has to name one male and one female flag-bearer. "The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) is pleased to announce Mr Manpreet Singh, the captain of the men's hockey team, as a Flagbearer of Team India for the Opening Ceremony of the Birmingham 2022 Olympic Games alongside shuttler Ms PV Sindhu," the IOA said in a release.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>The decision to name Mr Singh, who led the Indian men's hockey team to a bronze medal at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics last year, as the second Flagbearer for the said occasion was arrived at after the IOA was intimated by the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee that two Flagbearers - one male and one female - must be named by each nation for the Opening Ceremony,</q> the statement further added.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>Mr Manpreet Singh ended Indian hockey's 41-year Olympic medal drought with a bronze at the Tokyo Olympics last year. He is one of the finest athletes to have ever represented India on the international stage. We are delighted to name him and Ms Sindhu as the two Flagbearers who will lead the Indian contingent out at the Parade of Nations tomorrow during the Opening Ceremony of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games," said IOA Acting President Mr Anil Khanna.</h4></p>
    <p><h4>Neeraj Chopra was set to be the flagbearer, but he sustained an injury during the World Athletics Championships, where he won a silver medal.</h4></p>

    <p><h1><font color="blue">'Keeper' Of Indian Hockey Team's Fortunes: Sreejesh Ready For Memorable CWG Swansong</font></h1></p>
    <p><h4>At 34 and in the twilight zone, all that is left for PR Sreejesh is to tick a couple of boxes in a career that has been filled with numerous ups and a few downsPress Trust of IndiaUpdated: July 26, 2022 04:37 PM ISTRead Time:3 min
    <p><h4> PR Sreejesh feels his chequered international career resembles Malayali staple 'Avial' - a mixed curry of 13 vegetables. At 34 and in the twilight zone, all that is left for Sreejesh is to tick a couple of boxes in a career that has been filled with numerous ups and a few downs. A second Olympic medal wrapped around his neck with the gigantic Eiffel Tower looming over him is an ultimate dream but for now, he wants to be that safe 'check-post' in what will be his third and last Commonwealth Games. <q>The life was always not the same. It was always full of ups and downs. I had some really good matches as well some real bad outings. I had a bad start to my career, then gradually, I have risen up the ranks to become India's No.1 keeper,</q> Sreejesh told PTI in an interview.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>From witnessing the low of 2012 London Olympics to winning bronze in Tokyo, in between I captained the national team and then in 2018, my career was almost over due to an ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) injury. In Kerala, we have a famous dish called 'avial'. It's a 13-vegetable curry. I can relate my career to avial.</q> At the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea, Sreejesh starred in Indian's gold medal win, when he saved two attempts in a shoot-out against Pakistan in the final. At the 2014 and 2018 Champions Trophy, he was adjudged <q>Goalkeeper of the Tournament</q>.</h4></p>
    <p><h4>At this stage of his career, Sreejesh prefers short targets.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>As a youngster, I always used to plan for four years. Now, I always prefer short-term goals. Now my priority is CWG, then my next step is World Cup for sure. When you are keeping short targets that always helps you to focus more on your performance, fitness and mental strength.</q> So he basically plans to carry on till the Paris Olympics.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>Looking forward, Paris is feasible. I can see the Eiffel Tower but that road is not going to be easy. I believe these small steps will help me reach there,</q> the lanky goalkeeper said.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>Another Commonwealth Games is a tricky one because in another four years, I don't think I will be able to sustain (my fitness) but who knows there you can see me as a coach." Sreejesh believes goalkeepers are like vintage wine, which gets better with age, as he reflected on his illustrious career, where he started by warming the bench and went on to become one of the best in the world.</h4></p>
    <p><h4>He said the setbacks in the early part of his career taught him lessons to use failures as building blocks for success.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>When I started my career, I used to concede a lot of goals. The best part of a goalkeeper is that when you are the second choice, you get to gain a lot of experience by sitting outside and watching. I learned the game by watching the likes of Devesh Chauhan, Adrian D'Souza, Bharat Chettri.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>Over a period, I had seniors, who corrected me and covered for me. If I would have been drafted straightaway in the main team, I would have finished by now because the pressure is too high at the international level and youngster might find it difficult to handle at the onset,</q> Sreejesh said.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>That's why we always say goalkeepers get better as they get older. Goalkeepers are like vintage wine because with age, their maturity level goes high, their pressure-handling gets better and they take decisions wisely.</q> Talking about the upcoming CWG, Sreejesh believes India have the potential to finish on the podium but overcoming the mighty Australians would be key in deciding the colour of the medal.</h4></p>

    <p><h4>A three-member FIH delegation, led by newly-appointed acting president Seif Ahmed, is expected to visit India on August 15 for an emergency meeting to assess progress made with regards to adoption of a new Constitution, which is a must to salvage the World Cup, the country is scheduled to host in 2023. FIH CEO Thierry Weil and Executive Board member Tayyab Ikram, who is also the CEO of Asian Hockey Federation, will be part of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) delegation.</h4></p>
    <p><h4>The FIH on Wednesday sought a "detailed timeline" from the court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) on adoption of amended Constitution and holding of fresh elections of Hockey India. If Hockey India does not adopt a Sports Code-compliant Constitution at the earliest, the country runs the risk of losing the hosting rights of World Cup, scheduled to be held from January 13 to 29.</h4></p>
    <p><h4>FIH CEO Weil said they have set a tentative date for the visit and are now awaiting a confirmation from the CoA, which is running the game in the country after the Delhi High Court suspended Hockey India's Executive Board for violation of the National Sports Code.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>We are planning to visit India on August 15 for 2 to 3 days. We will do whatever is required to solve the matter but we are still awaiting a response from the CoA,</q> Weil told PTI from Lausanne in an exclusive interaction.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>It would be a three-member delegation led by acting president Seif Ahmed. We are ready to meet anyone and extend all possible help to sort out the issues.</q> FIH has written thrice to CoA on the matter but has not got any response as yet.</h4></p>
    <p><h4> Weil said the FIH is still hopeful of hosting the World Cup in Bhubaneswar and Rourkela but if things don't work out next month, a possible ban on Hockey India is a possibility.</h4></p>
    <p><h4><q>Definitely, there will be penalties coming in on Hockey India for non-delivery of commitments and one of those will be a ban from international hockey. They have signed an agreement for staging the World Cup and they are obliged to deliver on this.</h4></p>

    <p><h4> Skipper Savita Punia starred in front of the goal as India defeated Canada 3-2 in the shootout after both teams were tied 1-1 at the end of regulation time in their classification match of the FIH Women's Hockey World Cup in Amstelveen on Tuesday. Madeline Secco (11th) handed Canada the lead before Salima Tete (58th) left it late to equalise for India. But it was Savita's heroics in front of the goal that gave India their first win of the tournament. The Indian captain led from the front and pulled off as many as six saves in the shootout, while Navneet Kaur, Sonika and Neha converted their chances in the ninth to 16th place classification match.</h4></p>
    <p><h4>After soaking up the initial pressure from the Indians, Canada managed to put the ball into the India net, but it was disallowed as the referee awarded a penalty corner and Natalie Sourisseau's attempt was off target.</h4></p>
    <p><h4>Canada went one better a few minutes later as they won another penalty corner. This time the variation created confusion in the India defence, and Kathleen Leahy passed it to Secco for the final touch to stun the Indians.</h4></p>
    <p><h4>India once again came out stronger in the second quarter and penetrated the Canadian defence on numerous occasions.
    <p><h4></h4>Monika, in particular, used her array of 3D skills to get past the Canada defence as goalkeeper Rowan Harris urged her team to maintain focus.</h4></p>
    <p><h4> As the game moved towards half-time, India upped the ante.</h4></p>
    <p><h4> Navneet Kaur, Neha and Vandana Katariya moved with freedom as Canada looked very much on the back foot.</h4></p>
    <p><h4>In the 25th minute, Navneet and Vandana combined to create a fine chance but the shot was kept out by Canadian goalie Harris, as India trailed by a goal at half-time.</h4></p>
    <p><h4>After the change of ends, India continued to pile on the pressure, with Lalremsiami making some speedy forays into the Canada circle.</h4></p>
