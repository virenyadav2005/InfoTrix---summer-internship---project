            <p><h1><font color="red">Barcelona set to sign Poland striker Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich</font></h1></p>
            <p><h4>The two European clubs have reached an agreement for Lewandowski's move to Camp Nou, Bayern president Herbert Hainer said.
                <ul type="disc" class="unorderedlist">
                HIGHLIGHTS
            <p><h4><li>The transfer would cost Barcelona around 50 million euros ($50.4 million), according to reports.</li></h4></p>
            <p><h4><li>The decision to make him a part of Barcelona will boost the club's chances to win</li></h4></p>
             
                </ul>
            <p><h4>Barcelona is set to sign Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski. This move of acquiring a world-class scorer who can finally help fill the void after Lionel Messi's exit last summer will be a bold move by the club that is debt-ridden.</h4></p>               
            <p><h4>The two European clubs have reached an agreement for Lewandowski's move to Camp Nou, Bayern president Herbert Hainer said.</h4></p>                      
            <p><h4>“We have come to a verbal agreement with Barcelona. It's good to have clarity for all parties," Hainer said on Bayern's official social media account. "Robert is an incredible player and he won everything with us. We are incredibly grateful to him.”</h4></p>               
            <p><h4>  The transfer would cost Barcelona around 50 million euros ($50.4 million), according to reports.</h4></p>               
            <p><h4>If the fee is confirmed, it would be a club-record sale fee for Bayern, exceeding the 40 million euros ($40.3 million) the German champion received from Juventus for Douglas Costa in 2018.</h4></p>               
            <p><h4>The 33-year-old Lewandowski is one of soccer's most prolific scorers of the past decade. The decision to make him a part of Barcelona will boost the club's chances of rebuilding a competitive team after winning nothing last season.</h4></p>               
            <p><h4> Lewandowski has scored 312 goals in 384 Bundesliga games for Bayern and his previous club Borussia Dortmund. He hit 35 goals in 34 appearances last season to become the Bundesliga's leading scorer for the seventh time overall. On the other hand, Barcelona's top scorers were Memphis Depay and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang with 13 goals each last campaign.</h4></p>              
            <p><h4>Lewandowski had stated in late May that “my story with Bayern Munich is over” after contract extension talks with Bayern broke down. He had one more season left on his contract with Bayern.</h4></p>        
            <p><h4>Barcelona is currently in debt mostly due to the huge transfer fees and salaries paid out by its previous president and board. In order to make signings this summer, current president Joan Laporta had to sell 10% of the team's Spanish league television rights for the next 25 years in exchange for 207.5 million euros ($207.5 million).</h4></p>               
            <p><h4>Now, with Lewandowski's inclusion, the club is clearly betting on winning titles again in the short term</h4></p>

            <p><h4> Manchester United signed Denmark's Christian Eriksen to a three-year contract on Friday.
            <p><h4> The 30-year-old Eriksen had played for Brentford in the second half of last season. He had joined the London club almost eight months after collapsing from cardiac arrest at the European Championship.</h4></p>
            <p><h4> Eriksen has played for Tottenham. He is Man United's second major signing under manager Erik ten Hag following the arrival of left-back Tyrell Malacia from Dutch club Feyenoord.</h4></p>

            <p><h4>Eriksen said he has spoken with Ten Hag <q>and learned more about his vision and the way he wants the team to play, I am even more excited for the future.</q></h4></p>

            <p><h4> All India Football Federation submitted the final draft constitution to the Supreme Court on Friday.  This was framed by the Committee of Administrators (CoA).</h4></p>
            <p><h4> AIFF acting general secretary Sunando Dhar said: "After a lengthy set of discussions with various stakeholders, the draft Constitution of the AIFF has finally been submitted to the honourable court.</h4></p>
            <p><h4><q>I would like to congratulate everyone involved in the process, on this swift move forward, and hope that with the new constitution in place, we can move ahead with developing Indian football.</q></h4></p>
            <p><h4> The CoA comprises Justice (retired) Anil R Dave, former Chief Election Commissioner of India Dr. SY Quraishi, and former India captain Bhaskar Ganguly.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>The apex court directed the CoA to assist in facilitating the adoption of the constitution and prepare electoral rolls to conduct elections of the AIFF at the earliest.</h4></p>
            <p><h4> Since then, in the course of formulating the draft constitution, the CoA has <q>put in more than 150 hours of work and has spoken to all the AIFF’s stakeholders, including state associations, FIFA, AFC, ISL, and I-League clubs and considered suggestions forwarded by them</q>.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>Three days ago, the CoA sent the final draft constitution to the world football governing body, FIFA.</h4></p>
            <p><h4><q>After a lot of deliberation, we have finally narrowed down on a draft constitution that would put the AIFF in line with the National Sports Code, as well as help it function efficiently as a member association of the FIFA and the AFC,</q> said Quraishi.</h4></p>

            <p><h4>The next date of the Supreme Court hearing on the matter is 21st July. Once the Supreme Court gives a green signal, a Special General Body Meeting of the AIFF is expected to be called within seven days to approve the new constitution.</h4></p>

            <p><h1><font color="yellow">England beats Spain 2-1 to reach Euro 2022 semifinals</font></h1></p>
            <p><h4>Georgia Stanway scored an extra-time winner to seal a 2-1 comeback win for England over Spain on Wednesday.</h4></p>
            <p><h4></h4>England's Georgia Stanway (R) celebrates with Lauren Hemp after scoring a goal during the Women's Euro 2022 quarterfinal against Spain.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>Georgia Stanway scored an extra-time winner to seal a 2-1 comeback win for England over Spain on Wednesday and send her team to the semifinals of the Women's European Championship With the score 1-1 after 90 minutes, Spain left Stanway with space to hit a powerful drive from outside the penalty area which flew past leaping goalkeeper Sandra Panos' outstretched hand.</h4></p>
            <p><h4><q>Unreal. That just shows the level that we are at, we get a setback and we come back and do it. Job done and focus on the semis," Stanway told the BBC. “It (the goal) is definitely one to be proud of, I will remember today, we put in a massive, massive shift. We are going to enjoy this moment and then crack on.</q></h4></p>
            <p><h4>After a first half with few clear chances, Esther González gave Spain the lead in the 54th minute off a smart pass from Athenea Del Castillo. A shake-up by England manager Sarina Wiegman was rewarded in the 84th when two substitutes combined to level the score, Alessia Russo heading a cross on for Ella Toone to volley in.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>England will play either Sweden or Belgium on Tuesday in its sixth appearance in the semifinals. England has never won the European title. Spain, which had to play the tournament without injured Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas, missed the chance to reach the semifinals for the first time in 25 years.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>England struggled from the start with Spain's smart passing and tough tackling, while winger Del Castillo was a force on the right flank after coming on at halftime.</h4></p> 
            <p><h4>She beat left-back Rachel Daly and cut the ball back for González to knock the ball low past goalkeeper Mary Earps, the first time England had conceded in the tournament.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>England coach Sarina Wiegman, back in the stadium after missing the previous game because of a positive COVID-19 test, shook things up by substituting out Ellen White and Beth Mead, who had scored seven goals between them in the group stage, then fellow regular Fran Kirby soon after.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>As England faced an early elimination in front of a packed home crowd, the payoff for Wiegman's substitutions came when Stanway's cross was flicked on by Russo for fellow replacement Toone to volley in her first goal of Euro 2022. Spain appealed that Russo had fouled captain Irene Paredes while challenging for the ball, but the referee wasn't interested.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>After Stanway blasted England into the lead six minutes into extra time, Spain surged forward with hopes of taking the game to penalties. Aitana Bonmati sent a shot wide from a good position, and goalkeeper Paños went into attack at a corner, the ball deflecting off her head and out of danger.</h4></p> 
            <p><h4>The final whistle prompted joyful England celebrations as players did a lap of the field dancing and singing with the crowd.</h4></p>

            <p><h1><font color="darkblack">Jamaica qualify for FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 despite turmoil</font></h1></p>
            <p><h4>The Reggae Girlz have made a dramatic climb onto the international stage. The team didn't exist just six years ago and it has had to constantly struggle for funding.</h4></p>
            <p><h4></h4>Jamaica's Tiernny Wiltshire (19) and United States' Sophia Smith fight for the ball during a CONCACAF Women's Championship football match in Monterrey, Mexico.</h4></p>
            <p><h4> Jamaica has qualified for the 2023 Women's World Cup as one of the top four finishers at the CONCACAF W Championship. The Reggae Girlz next face Canada on Thursday night in the tournament semifinals.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>Next summer's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand will mark Jamaica's second appearance in soccer's premier tournament. They were the first-ever Caribbean team to make the field in 2019.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>The Reggae Girlz have made a dramatic climb onto the international stage. The team didn't exist just six years ago and it has had to constantly struggle for funding.</h4></p>
            <p><h4><q>There’s so much higher levels that we can reach with even more investment from back home,” forward Kayla McCoy said. “So we’re kind of excited to see what comes from us qualifying again, because not a lot of people thought we could do it again. I think it kind of solidified us into this position and now people know that that we’re for real and will begin to invest a bit more.</q></h4></p>
            <p><h4>The team was disbanded in 2008 after failing to qualify for the 2007 World Cup and the 2008 Olympics.
            <p><h4>In 2014, Bob and Rita Marley's eldest daughter, Cedella, made it her mission to resurrect the team. While Jamaica didn't qualify for the 2015 World Cup in Canada, the team attracted fans through its connection to the Marley family.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>Cedella Marley has been a tireless ambassador for the team, drumming up much-needed sponsors. A GoFundMe was once set up to help Jamaica train and players have held other fundraisers. But even with success, the Reggae Girlz struggle to get funding from the Jamaican federation.</h4></p>
            <p><h4> Jamaica has also overcome considerable turbulence at the helm in recent years. Coach Lorne Donaldson just took over at the beginning of June — he's had just a month with the team.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>After Hue Menzies resigned because of a pay dispute with the federation following the 2019 World Cup, he was replaced in 2020 by Hubert Busby Jr., who has been accused of sexual misconduct while coaching a women's club team in Canada. He has denied the allegations.</h4></p>
            <p><h4> Busby was dismissed late last year and Jamaica appointed Vin Blaine, who was forced to resign after 20 national team players sent a letter to the federation saying they could not support him.</h4></p>
            <p><h4><q>I think the important thing for us as a group is that we stuck together through everything and we overcame those challenges,</q> McCoy said. <q>The women on this team have had each other’s backs from the start and from the beginning, and I think the group that we have, and the family that we have is what has kept us going through all of this and what has kept us kind of overcoming those obstacles.</q>
            <p><h4>There's also been personal tragedy during CONCACAF qualifying. A promising youth national team player, Jedine Carr, was killed in a shooting Friday while on her way to a club team practice in Jamaica.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>A moment of silence was used to honor Carr before the final group stage matches at the tournament. Khadija Shaw held up Carr's jersey when the team celebrated its victory over Haiti that secured its World Cup berth.</h4></p>
