            <h4>It’s getting a little bit dangerous the grip that IPL has: Adam Gilchrist</h4>
            <p><h4>Veteran Australian player Adam Gilchrist has stated his concerns over the dominant position held by the IPL franchises in global cricket and their power over where the players can and can not play. He further went on to term the trend as dangerous. </h4></p>
            <p><h4>Gilchrist's comments have come in the backdrop of reports stating that Australian batter David Warner might opt out of the upcoming Big Bash League (BBL) this season and sign up for a more lucrative United Arab Emirates T20 league.</h4></p>
            <p><h4><q>They can’t force David Warner to play in BBL, I understand that, but to let him then go off – or another player, let’s not single out Warner because there will be other players on the radar – it’s all part of this global dominance that these IPL franchises are starting to create given they own a number of teams in Caribbean Premier League,</q> Gilchrist told SEN’s Whateley radio show.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>Three IPL franchises - Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Capitals, have all invested in teams in the UAE T20 league. </h4></p>
            <p><h4><q>It’s getting a little bit dangerous the grip that it’s having to monopolise that ownership and the ownership of the players and their talents and where they can and can’t play,</q> he added. The three-time World Cup winner Australian suggested his country's cricket board to take cognizance of the matter as more cricketers could take Warner's path sooner than later. </h4></p>               
            <p><h4><q>If he (Warner) rides off into the sunset and says, ‘Sorry Australian cricket, I’m going to become a gun for hire for my Indian franchise team in various tournaments’ you can’t question him on that, that’s his prerogative and he’s done everything he needs to get the profile and get that market value,</q> Gilchrist said.  Gilchrist further pointed out that it will be really challenging once this starts happening with young, up-and-coming players.  </h4></p></div><hr color="darkblack">

            <p><h4>KL Rahul is set to miss to entire T20 leg of the West Indies tour, according to reports. It is understood that Rahul has recovered from COVID, but the BCCI medical team has advised another week of rest for the LSG skipper.</h4></p> 
            <p><h4>Earlier, it was believed that upon proving his fitness, Rahul would fly to West Indies for the last two T20s. Rahul would now aim to make a strong comeback for in three-match ODI series against Zimbabwe, which is set to begin on August 18. </h4></p>
            <p><h4>KL Rahul headed to Germany last month as he underwent the knife for hernia surgery. Rahul had sustained the injury on the eve of the first T20I match that India was scheduled to play against the Proteas at Arun Jaitley stadium in Delhi.</h4></p> 
            <p><h4>Rahul's injury was considered a mild strain initially, but before anyone knew it, it soon aggravated into serious wear and tear. Rahul had to miss the entire English tour. Reports then came out of the NCA today that Rahul tested positive and was isolating himself as a part of a precautionary measure.</h4></p>                
            <p><h4>In Rahul's absence, Team India decided to open the innings with swashbuckling Rishabh Pant. The move was appreciated all over as there were a lot of calls to let Pant open the innings in the shortest format of the game. It would be interesting to see what happens when Rahul ultimately makes his comeback in the T20 setup.  KL Rahul has played 42 Tests, 42 ODIs, and 56 T20Is for India in the last eight years</h4></p></div><hr color="darkblack">

            <p><h1><font color="orange">IND vs WI: Here's recap of Team India's key moments from first two ODIs ahead of last match </font></h1></p>
            <p><h4>From Shikhar Dhawan to Axar Patel, let's take a look at some brilliant performances by players that led India clinch a series win.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>In the ongoing three-match ODI series between India and West Indies, the Shikhar Dhawan-led team has registered a series win by winning the first two matches.               
            <p><h4>Both the victories were close wins and if not for some wonderful performances and moments in these matches, India wouldn't have managed to succeed.</h4></p>
            <p><h4><b><u> Here's a look at those turning points from the first two ODIs played at the Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad.</u></b></h4></p>     
            <p><h4> From Dhawan's power hitting, complimented by Shubman Gill's aggressive batting to Mohammad Siraj's emergence as the leader of the bowling attack, India ticked all the boxes in the 1st ODI.</h4></p>
                <ul type="disc">
            <p><h4><li>Shikhar Dhawan's power hitting-</li></h4>Skipper Dhawan who opened for Team India, started the innings with a bang. However, his wicket on 97 was a heartbreak for the Indian fans and Dhawan's hunt for his 18th century in ODI and the 1st ODI century in West Indies is still on.</p>
            <p><h4><li>Shubman Gill's fifty -</li></h4>
                Gill scored his first ODI fifty off 36 balls. He hammered 6 boundaries and 2 sixes.</p>               
            <p><h4><li>Mohammad Siraj's bowling spell and Sanju Samson's amazing save -</li></h4>
                During the last over, the Caribbean team needed 15 runs from 6 deliveries to win. Akeal Hosein and Romario Shepherd who shared a partnership of 42 runs from 27 deliveries were at the crease. At one time it seemed that the West Indies team would win the match, but Mohammad Siraj and Sanju Samson together ruined their hopes.</p>                
            <p><h4>Watch Highlights of 1st ODI: </h4></p>

                In the 2nd ODI, after Shai Hope and Nicholas Pooran's hammering of 115 runs and 74 runs each leading the Caribbean team to add a target of 311, it seemed visibly difficult for team India to win. However, Axar Patel's heroics led India to a two-wicket win.</p>                
            <p><h4><li>Sanju Samson's maiden ODI fifty:</li></h4>
                 Samson who was being criticized for not utilizing the opportunity of being in the playing XI, proved all the critics wrong by a knock of 54 runs off 51 deliveries with three boundaries and three sixes.</p>               
            <p><h4><li>Shreyas Iyer's consecutive half-century:</li></h4>
                 After strenghthening the opening stand in the first ODI by scoring a fifty, Iyer gave a consistent performance and made 63 off 71 balls.</p>                
            <p><h4><li>Man of the Match - Axar Patel:</li></h4>
                 Just when the Windies were on the verge of celebration after the collapse of India's batting order, Patel took the onus and took the win away. He scored 64 of just 35 balls. Moreover, he took a catch and a wicket too.</p>
